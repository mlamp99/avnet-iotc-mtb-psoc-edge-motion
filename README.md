## Avnet PSOC™ Edge DEEPCRAFT™ Motion

This demo project is the integration of Infineon's [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Machine learning – DEEPCRAFT™ deploy motion](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-ml-deepcraft-deploy-motion/tree/release-v2.0.0)
and [Avnet /IOTCONNECT ModusToolbox&trade; SDK](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotc-mtb-sdk). 

This code example demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning (ML) model to detect motion generated using DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio on Infineon's PSOC&trade; Edge MCU.

This example deploys DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio's human activity detection starter model on the PSOC&trade; Edge MCU. This model uses data from the BMI270 IMU to detect various motions such as standing, running, walking, sitting, and jumping.

This project has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

The M55 processor performs the DEEPCRAFT™ model heavy lifting and reports the data via IPC to the M33 processor.
The M33 Non-Secure application is a custom /IOTCONNECT application that is receiving the IPC messages, 
processing the data and sending it to /IOTCONNECT. 
This application can receive Cloud-To-Device commands as well and control one of the board LEDs or control the application flow.    

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) with MTB Tools v3.6 or later (tested with v3.6)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

> **Note:**
> This code example fails to build in RELEASE mode with the GCC_ARM toolchain v14.2.1 as it does not recognize some of the Helium instructions of the CMSIS-DSP library.

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

## Set Up The Project

To set up the project, please refer to the 
[/IOTCONNECT ModusToolbox&trade; PSOC Edge Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)

## Running The Demo

- Once the board connects to /IOTCONNECT, it will begin sending telemetry packets similar to the example below:
```
>: {"d":[{"d":{"version":"1.1.0","random":32,"confidence":86,"class_id":1,"class":"standing","event_detected":true}}]}
```

- While holding the kit board in your hand, perform various activities 
such as *sitting, standing, walking, running, or jumping* 
and observe if the model detects and reports the correct activity.


- For proper detection, the sensor on the board must be oriented in the same general way in which it is trained. 
The orientation for *sitting* (KitProg USB facing forward with EVK towards the ground) and *standing* (KitProg USB facing forward with EVK towards the body). 
For *walking, running, and jumping*, hold the board in the same orientation as standing with the normal arm movements associated with the activity.


- The following commands can be sent to the device using the /IOTCONNECT Web UI:

    | Command                  | Argument Type     | Description                                                        |
    |:-------------------------|-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `board-user-led`         | String (on/off)   | Turn the board LED on or off                                                                                                                                                |
    | `set-reporting-interval` | Number (eg. 2000) | Set telemetry reporting interval in milliseconds.  By default, the application will report every 2000ms                                     |
